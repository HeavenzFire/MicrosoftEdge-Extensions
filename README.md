The [microsoft / MicrosoftEdge-Extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions) repo contains Microsoft Edge extensions samples, issues, and discussions.

The [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home) website is the store for Microsoft Edge extensions (add-ons), where browser extension developers can publish their Microsoft Edge add-ons and make them available to Microsoft Edge users.

The [Microsoft Edge Add-ons Developer](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/extensions/) portal is a central place to find all information and resources for Microsoft Edge extension developers.
